      <p>Ruan was a great nerd, born in <span class="year">1994</span>. He lives most of his life with his 
        family. But when he finished highschool in <span class="year">2011</span>, 
        he moved to Nova Igua√ßu to study. After that, he also moved to Tijuca, 
        with the same goal. That year, he confirmed his IT skills. But life is crazy,
         some problems get him and, in <span class="year">2019</span>, he came back with more strength and went back on his studies.
          In <span class="year">2020</span>, he started working as a developer trainee in a company of software development.
